He’s even gone so far as to block legitimate customers, including Torn's NPCs, from buying from his bazaar, ensuring there are always plenty of overpriced grenades, Vicodin, and mistletoe to go around—at an inflated price, of course.",

			"Described as a big ol' teddy bear with a thing for little people, is0lati0n was a key member of Chedburn's support team during Torn's crucial first few years. A skilled programmer, he helped create the original racing feature in the days before we enjoyed such luxuries as watching dots move around a 2D track. Is0 was also a trusted staff member, often called upon for impartial investigations—most notably during the infamous fedding of Tea by LeukyBear. Yet, is0lati0n's own reputation wasn’t exactly squeaky clean, as suggested by his staff item, the Brutus Key Chain. The real-life reference behind this item might be too risqué for a PG-13 game… oh, who are we kidding? It was a home-made dildo.",
