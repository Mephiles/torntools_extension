During her teenage years, mathematician and convicted felon Jennifer Yellow-Hat noticed that her friends had an astounding ability to recall her words whenever she wore a bulky sweater. Conversely, on days where her cleavage was on display, her associates\' efforts to memorise facts and figures failed repeatedly. Her conclusion that the presence of breasts reduces the human mind\'s capacity for memory helped one Harvard student to a 100% grade on his advanced physics paper, and in <span class="italic">Memories and Mammaries</span> Ms Yellow-Hat explains how you too can improve information retention with three simple boob banishing techniques.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n<span class="bold">"What\'s my name again?
