This condition was caused by a blow to the head suffered when a 6 year old Pharrell was hit by an ice cream truck whilst walking his dog. However, when the young RnB sensation awoke to find his canine companion had passed away after gorging itself on chocolate snow-cones spilled during the accident, he found the news so funny he became unable to shed tears ever again.

Created as a refinement of the Stoner 86 model, the 96 design enjoys lower recoil than its predecessor due to its use of a stock buffer and its ability to fire with an open bolt. These modifications mean that the 96 Stoner is shorter and lighter than the 86 at the expense of a reduced fire rate.",
